### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project provides an interactive Python script to explore statistics derived from data collected by [Motivate](https://motivateco.com/) for a bikeshare program conducted in 2017.

Statistics can be calculated from data collected for the bikeshare program in any one of these three cities:
- Chicago
- New York City
- Washington, D.C.

The script provides the option for further filtering the statistics by day of the week and/or month of the year.

### Files used
- `bikeshare_2.py` - interactive Python script
- Cleaned CSV files with bikeshare data for each city:
  - `chicago.csv`
  - `new_york_city.csv`
  - `washington.csv`

### Credits
Interactive Python script originally created from `bikeshare_2.py` template provided by Udacity for this project, with contributions informed by "practice problems" presented by Udacity associated with this project.
